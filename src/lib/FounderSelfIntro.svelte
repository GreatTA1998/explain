      Youtube and KhanAcademy are amazing. But starting a channel is so unpredictable and time-consuming that many great explainers can't afford to do it.

      When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed 1-2 hours. 
      I lost count of the times I’ve been abandoned in Office Hours, or signed up for “free tutoring” that never became available. Later I learnt that colleges compete on prestige, not on teaching quality.

    <div class="arcane-paragraph">
      I was inspired by Youtube and KhanAcademy - they've shown the promise of making great explanations accessible to people.
      But there is far too few content creators for advanced subjects. explanations.app is a more balanced, creator-centric platform, 
      where anyone can explain things they love to a small audience of paying subscribers in a Q&A format, without the need for time-consuming editing, virality and unpredictable recommendation algorithms.

    <div class="arcane-paragraph">
      I quit my job at Apple in 2020 to work on this full-time. Working with universities has scarred me, but now I live in Tokyo to save money, 
      living in a $450/month sharehouse. I take out the trash for all my roommates to save a further $50/month. Even though I burn out easily, <b>I'll do what it takes to make this happen</b>.

    <div class="arcane-paragraph">
      If you're on the fence about teaching or learning on explanations.app, give me a chance to work with you :^)
