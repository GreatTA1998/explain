      Youtube and KhanAcademy are amazing. But starting a channel is so unpredictable and time-consuming that many great explainers can't afford to do it.

      When I was studying at MIT, I often had to wait 40-60 minutes in line just to get 5 minutes of “help” from a TA - when I needed 1-2 hours. 
      I lost count of the times I’ve been abandoned in Office Hours, or signed up for “free tutoring” that never became available.

      It turns out universities operate like luxury markets, where they compete on prestige. Yet prestige in education isn't based on teaching performance, but
      how prestigious you already are (peer-assessed reputation), how much money you have (endowment size), how many papers you publish (research output), how many students you turn away (selectivity), 
      and many factors that have nothing to do with teaching performance.

    <div class="arcane-paragraph">
      (I concede that prestige create secondary effects for the institution and its members - effects that are highly valuable. It attracts world talent to the institution, resulting in a network effect that attracts even more resources. 
      It's a good deal for those who get the credentials and benefit from peer effects. But this misses the point. Of course a monopoly benefits from its monopoly status! The point is that it has negative effects for everyone else - with the ridiculous tuition expenses being the obvious tell.)

      This creates perverse incentives, incentives that explains all kinds of perverse phenomenon. 
      For one, how could a well-funded, top ranked computer science program have

        110 students signing a petition outcrying the lack of TA support in 2022</a>. Today, MIT is still ranked #1 on QS. 
        This contrast with sport, where the NY Yankees can be the richest team but still lose, and the Oakland As can be the poorest but still win. Despite the uneven budgets, there's at least fair competition in the MLB.

      Ultimately, there is no skin-in-the-game for anyone to care about student outcomes. Ironically, even when people care, it usually causes harm: banning video recordings due to its effect on attendance. Restricting access to past material to prevent cheating and misuse, 
      even if it'd have been immensely useful for most reasonable students.
      Insisting on 1-on-1 Office Hours no matter how overwhelmed the TAs are. In other words, "We know what's best for you even though we don't care about you."
      Such a paradoxical combination is deadly - to be deeply opinionated about how you live, but not care at all if you actually live well;
      at least controlling parents still wish their children to succeed.

    <div class="arcane-paragraph">
      Without a higher power - "wins" or "losses", there is simply no mechanism for backward beliefs to be corrected.
      MIT, unlike the Yankees, can't lose lest a miracle. There's something really wrong here.

      I love Youtube and KhanAcademy, they've have shown the promise of making great explanations accessible to people.
      As imperfect and flawed it is, especially that students need social structure, it's far better than the
      rottenness of higher education.
      But there is far too few content creators for advanced subjects.

    <div class="arcane-paragraph"> 
      explanations.app is a more creator-friendly model, where every student pays a little, so creators can explain things they love without worrying about "coming up with video ideas", time-consuming editing, virality and unpredictable recommendation algorithms.

      I quit my job at Apple in 2020 to work on this full-time. Working with universities has scarred me, but now I live in Tokyo to save money, 
      living in a $450/month sharehouse, taking out the trash for everyone. For as long as I believe this is right, <b>I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this happen</b>.
