          Launched visual forum for physics as a Piazza upgrade

          Failed. For students, these classes with passionate teachers were very well-resourced (though resource intensive), 
          with great lectures, study groups, lots of Office Hours, Discord and Piazza.
        </li>
        <li>
          For teachers, Piazza saved them time from managing emails and announcements. A visual Piazza, on the other hand, would 
          require them to spend more time helping students, which is not what they want.

            The TAs didn't even show up to their own Office Hours in 2022.

          They didn't want a tool that'd require them to invest even more time in helping students.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students suffered, but they didn't want a solution where they had to help each other without the TAs. The reason they were stuck was that all their friends were also stuck too.

          I realized incentives is a key issue. I tried recruiting external tutors for classes lacking TAs, with the "video-enabled group tutoring" model. 
           But it was hard to find independent teachers for classes that, for similar reasons, were lacking TAs in the first place.
        </li>
        <li>
          I became a teacher myself and uploaded weekly videos unofficially on Piazza. I also became an official free tutor for the economics department, hourly rate of $16/hr.
          I learnt that tutoring was less rewarding than I expected. In contrast, my videos had 66 hours total watch time from lots of 14.01 students, despite that they knew
          I was not a TA.
        </li>
        <li>
          One of my tutees requested explain.mit.edu for linear algebra. 
          I recruited specifically for math and 4 passionate teachers Ben, Ammar, Josue and Noam. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Failed. Ben and Noam uploaded videos for Linear Algebra and Mechanics of Materials, 
          but these classes were fairly well-supported, and students didn't want to trust a resource that isn't endorsed by 
          their instructors that requires payment. 
        </li>
        <li>
          I was criticized publicly by students for running a paid service, and reported by anonymous faculty for misuse of the school domain. explanations.app became the new domain.

      Accepted that universities is a bad initial market. The incentives for teachers to innovate for students is too weak. 
      It's forbidden to charge students any amount of money for academic help, so alternative incentives can't be established.
